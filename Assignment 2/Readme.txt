I used Canvas to make my object and obstacles.
I can control my object using arrow keys, and I used keyup and keydown for implementing this.
Then I started animation of screen and then new obstacle started appearing after every 3 seconds randomly, I used Math.random to find random position of obstacles and gaps between them, because gaps between 2 obstacles also vary.
Then I stored track of Score also.
